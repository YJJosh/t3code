# Terminal history

Each terminal keeps up to 5,000 lines and 8 MiB of scrollback on its environment
server. T3 Code removes the oldest output when either limit is reached. A long
line can be shortened at the start. New terminal output is not truncated.

These limits apply when you reconnect and when T3 Code restores saved terminal
history. A client can show less scrollback than the server keeps.

On web and desktop, use Shift+PageUp and Shift+PageDown to read scrollback
without leaving terminal input. Ctrl+Shift+Home and Ctrl+Shift+End jump to the
start and latest output; use Cmd instead of Ctrl on macOS. Full-screen terminal
programs keep these navigation keys.

To copy all retained output, choose Select all in the terminal's context menu,
then copy. Cmd+A on macOS and Ctrl+Shift+A elsewhere select the same output.
Ctrl+A still moves to the beginning of shell input on Windows and Linux.
Jump to latest in the context menu returns to the current output.

On iPhone and iPad, long-press the terminal to paste or to choose Select Text.
Select Text shows the visible output, where you can copy text or tap a link.

## Sharing terminals with agents

Agents can open terminals in their thread for servers, long jobs, and interactive
programs. Those terminals appear in the thread's terminal drawer, and you take turns
with the agent: whoever has control types. The terminal toolbar on web and desktop,
and the terminal options menu on mobile, show when the agent has control.

- **Take over**, or just start typing, to take control from the agent. The agent
  can still read the terminal but cannot type until you give it back.
- **Give to agent** hands control of any terminal in the thread to its agent,
  including one you opened.

Agents can read every terminal in their thread. Starting, typing into, and closing
terminals need the thread to be in **Full access**; in other
[permission modes](./permission-modes.md) agents use their own approval-gated
shell tools. Busy, agent, and finished terminals collapse into running and settled
groups above the composer; choose one to open it.

## fish

T3 Code starts fish with `no-query-term`, avoiding startup waits for terminal
replies. This disables optional fish features that depend on those replies.
T3 Code's exported `fish_features` also hides any universal flags you set with
`set -U fish_features`.

To preserve those flags or enable queries with `query-term`, include them in
`fish_features` in the environment that launches T3 Code. A shell export applies
when you launch T3 Code from that shell; it does not configure a desktop app
launched from the Dock or Finder. Enabling queries can restore the startup wait.
